name = "Jim" # str
print(len(name))        #    like we can set discount on phone class

some_list = ["some","name"] # list
print(len(some_list))       ##    like we can set discount on keyboard class


# len function wrok with name variable and some_list variable -->mtlb ek len function kaisa react kr rha different variables k sath


# That's polymorphism in action, a single function does now
# how to handle different kinds of objects as expected!
